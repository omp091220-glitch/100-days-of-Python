Goals: Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables

I'll be building a Band Name Generator Program by the end of this day!
First of all, you need to download Pycharm - It is an IDE
What does the error SyntaxError : EOL while scanning string literal? Answer: It means that you have not used  '"' while using a print statement!
Concatenation is possible directly - Ex: print("I am a" + " " + "Student") is possible
Spaces are important in Python (Not inside a print statement, but outside the print statements)
Ex: (space)print("Hello World!") is wrong; but, print(space)("Hello World!") is correct but it will give you a warning for using a space in between 'print' and '()'
You take in input using 'input()'
You calculate the length of a string using 'len(string_name)'
Variable names like '1name', '2name', etc are error.
